The user would enter in their username, the helmet, body armor, and visor of the spartan they use. There was even a section for the user to takes notes if needed.\r\n\r\n### Halo 5: Guardians\r\nI wanted to make a program based off one of the video games I play, and Halo 5 happened to be one of my favorite right now. In the game the player is able to customize a Spartan Super Soldier to use in online multiplayer. So I thought I would create a program that would record the different armor permutations a spartan could have.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
